Third Party Licenses
====================

micro-ros-build does not directly contain 3rd party source code. 

nuttx_kconfig_vendor includes [kconfig frontends](https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/tools/src/master/kconfig-frontends/) as a submodule, and the NuttX build started by this package will use it at compile time. No part of kconfig frontends will be included in the resulting binaries.
